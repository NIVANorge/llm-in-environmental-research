I am screening papers for a systematic literature review.
The topic of the systematic review is assessing links between urban greenspaces and mental health in low- and middle-income countries. The general urban population of upper/lower-middle-income and low-income countries, as defined by OECD’s Development Assistance Committee (DAC) is included. Studies from high-income countries are excluded.
The study should focus exclusively on this topic.


I give 2 examples with title and abstract that should be included.

Example 1:
- Title: The Role of Historical Persian Gardens as Urban Green Spaces: Psychological, Physical, and Social Aspects
- Abstract: Parks and urban green spaces are important factors for the quality of life and promoting environmental justice. Although a high park utilization improves health and well-being, the Iranian urban residents have a low park utilization. Nevertheless, historical Persian gardens have remained as successful urban green spaces among urban residents. In this study, four well-known historical Persian gardens in Shiraz city (Eram, Hafeziyeh, Jahan Nama, and Afifabad) have been investigated on physical, social, and psychological aspects to identify their associations with the utilization of these spaces. Of 800 questionnaires distributed among adult residents in two seasons in these gardens, 775 questionnaires were collected. Connecting to nature, refreshing, and relaxing were detected as the most frequently referred reasons for garden visitation compared with social and physical activities. Attachment to place, aesthetics of gardens, accessibility, and feeling safe were associated with higher garden visitation. However, bonding with the place (as a psychological factor) and feeling safe (as a social factor) were more associated with garden visitation compared with aesthetics and accessibility of gardens (physical factor). The significant role of safety on mediating effects of other attributes on garden visitation was revealed, as well. So, park designers and planners should improve park qualities by investing in affective components, infrastructure, and activities, which support social benefits to increase the number of park users.

- Title: Exploring psychophysiological restoration and individual preference in the different environments based on virtual reality.
- Abstract: Accumulated evidence claims that urban green spaces (UGS) have a positive impact on the physical and mental health of humans. However, little information is available to clearly reveal what the most important driving factors are for human psychophysiological restoration. In order to unveil this uncertainty, this study employed virtual reality (VR) technology to investigate the physiological (electroencephalogram, EEG), and psychological (attention, positive mood, negative mood) responses and individual preferences for different urban environments. Participants (120) were recruited and randomly assigned to experience six different types of environments varying in land use and vegetation structures, which were: Grey space, blue space, open green space, partly open green space, partly closed green space, and closed green space. The results showed that the experience of the six environmental types through VR devices had positive restorative effects on the individuals' attentional fatigue and negative mood; however, all the participants obtained the highest levels of physiological stress restoration when asked to close their eyes for relaxation. The physiological measurements of the EEG showed no significant differences among the selected types of environments. Meanwhile, the results of the psychological measures suggested that only negative mood showed significant differences of change among the six types of environments, and while the partly open green space had the most positive effect on negative mood, the closed green space had the worst. The blue space and partly closed green space received higher recreational preference ratings than the other four environments, while the closed green space received the lowest recreational preference rating. Moreover, the findings showed that there was a strong positive correlation between people's preferences and the improvement of their positive mood. This indicated that as the popularity of a natural environment increased, so did the benefits of human health and well-being. In addition, this study shows that VR technology may be utilized as a possible surrogate measure to real scenes in evaluating human physiological and psychological restoration in the future. The present findings can provide the theoretical basis and practical guidance for future optimal planning of urban restorative environments.

Example 1:
- Title: The effects of a short forest recreation program on physiological and psychological relaxation in young Polish adults.
- Abstract: Forest recreation is an activity that could be successfully used to alleviate negative symptoms of stress in individuals. Multiple positive psychological and physiological effects have been described in the literature, especially regarding works describing research from Asian countries such as Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. In East-Central Europe, however, the effectuality of forest recreation has not been addressed in scientific research. Thus, a special recreation program was developed, and its usability was examined with the involvement of 21 young Polish adults. A pre- and post-test design was used, wherein four psychological questionnaires were applied (Profile of Mood States, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, Restorative Outcomes Scale, Subjective Vitality Scale), and physiological measures were assessed (pulse rate, blood pressure) before and after the program. A field study was also conducted at the nature reserve Redykajny, near the suburban forest of the city of Olsztyn. The recreational program had a significant impact on psychological and physiological parameters. After recreation, the negative mood markers of the negative affect decreased and the positive affect, including restoration and vitality, increased. Furthermore, pulse rates, systolic blood pressures, and mean arterial pressures of the participants were significantly lower after the program. These results reveal that the short forest recreation program may be effective in reducing negative symptoms of stress.

Example 2:
- Title: Iconic manakins and despicable grackles: Comparing cultural ecosystem services and disservices across stakeholders in Costa Rica
- Abstract: Despite the great cultural and economic benefits associated with birdwatching and other bird-related cultural ecosystem services (CES), little is known about the bird-related CES and disservices perceived by people, and how they differ across stakeholders and species. The goal of this study was to explore CES and disservices across three stakeholder groups in Northwestern Costa Rica. We conducted surveys (n = 404 total) in which we presented farmers (n = 140), urbanites (n = 149), and birdwatchers (n = 115) with illustrations and songs of bird species and collected participants’ ratings on items designed to measure multiple CES and disservices. We found bird-related CES and disservices were perceived as six different categories: identity, bequest, education, birdwatching, acoustic aesthetic, and disservices. The three stakeholder groups expressed varying preferences across services, disservices, and species. Specifically, birdwatchers ranked species higher in terms of their education scores and lower in disservices scores compared to the other two groups, whereas farmers scored species higher on identity scores compared to the other two groups. Farmers and urbanites had remarkably similar perceptions towards birds in general, but differed from birdwatchers. Our approach represents a novel method for assessing CES and disservices associated with species that can be adapted and modified for different taxa and multiple geographical contexts.


Decide if the following article should be included or excluded from the systematic review. I give the title and abstract of the article as input.

Please respond with a plain JSON, without any formatting or backticks, that adheres to the following format:
{
  "verdict": "<your verdict here, either 'include' or 'exclude'>",
  "explanation": "<detailed explanation to justify your verdict here>",
  "confidence": "<confidence level of your decision here>"
}

Be lenient. I prefer including papers by mistake rather than excluding them by mistake.
